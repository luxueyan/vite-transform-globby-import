This transform is an simple resolution for enchancement of 'import statement'. It just replace the globby 'import statement' with multiple import lines before the default transforms.

## Status

In rc.1 and will likely release 1.0 soon.

## Getting Started

### Install (yarn or npm)

`yarn add -D vite-transform-globby-import or npm i --dev vite-transform-globby-import`

### Usage

```javascript
// vite.config.js
const sharedConfig = {
  alias: {
    '/@/': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
  }
}
module.exports = {
  ...sharedConfig,
  transforms: [require('vite-transform-globby-import')(sharedConfig)]
}
```

Example: 

```ts
import routes from 'globby!../pages/**/route.ts'
// will be replaced to 
/*
 * import routes0 from '/@/pages/route.ts'
 * import routes1 from '/@/pages/demo/route.ts'
 * ...
 * const routes = { routes0, routes1, ... }
 *
 */
import * as routes from 'globby!../pages/**/route.ts'
// will be replaced to 
/*
 * import * as routes0 from '/@/pages/route.ts'
 * import * as routes1 from '/@/pages/demo/route.ts'
 * ...
 * const routes = { routes0, routes1, ... }
 *
 */
import { route } from 'globby!../pages/**/route.ts'
// will be replaced to 
/*
 * import { route as route0 } from '/@/pages/route.ts'
 * import { route as route1 } from '/@/pages/demo/route.ts'
 * ...
 * const route = { route0, route1, ... }
 *
 */

import { route as demo } from 'globby!../pages/**/route.ts'
// will be replaced to 
/*
 * import { route as demo0 } from '/@/pages/route.ts'
 * import { route as demo1 } from '/@/pages/demo/route.ts'
 * ...
 * const demo = { demo0, demo1, ... }
 *
 */
import imgs from 'globby!/@/assets/image/**/*.@(jpg|png)'
// These will be replaced to:
/*
 * import imgs0 from '/@/assets/image/demo.jpg'
 * import imgs1 from '/@/assets/image/demo/demo.png'
 * ...
 * const imgs = { imgs0, imgs1, ... }
 */
